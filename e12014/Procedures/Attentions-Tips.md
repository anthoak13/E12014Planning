1.	Take gloves, when use alcohol clean anything, especially operate the Epoxy, work in the clean room.
2.	Clean all the surfaces with Clean Cloth.
3.	Clean the epoxy contaminated surface, especially for those surfaces which need to be flat.
4.	Make a line marker on the circuit board according to the dowel pin holes, which can be taken as a useful reference point when we align the wires.
5.	The top aluminum plane should be fixed in the table with a Temporary Tape.
6.	When aligning the wire, low the frame slowly. Fix one 1 side, then move to the other side. ( Jon’s presentation also introduce this )
7.	Remove on the edge of wires, which maybe loose the tension, and especially the 1st-2nd wire’s distance is not accurate.
8.	Make an aluminum tray to receive the dropped EZ-poxy.
9.	Put a thin clean cloth on the wire surface plane, receiving the escaped rosin in the soldering process.
